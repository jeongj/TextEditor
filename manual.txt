CONFIGURATION FILE

Your settings (font choices, colors, recent files, etc.) are stored in a file named editor_settings.json. This file is located in the same folder as the application.

If you ever want to reset the editor to its original, default settings, simply delete the editor_settings.json file. A new one will be created the next time you launch the editor.

FAQ

Q: My settings didn't save! Why?
A: Settings are saved when the VERY LAST editor window is closed. If you have multiple windows open, your most recent changes will only be saved when you close the final one.

Q: The application won't start. What should I do?
A: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run applications in the folder where it's located. On macOS, you may need to right-click the app and choose "Open" the very first time you run it.

Enjoy using your new text editor!
